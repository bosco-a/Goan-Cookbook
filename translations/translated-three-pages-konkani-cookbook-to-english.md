**Title:** "A Few Words of Introduction"

This Goan Cookery Book was created to provide guidance to our new cooks, and now that I am publishing it, it is intended to be a helpful reference for everyone.

This book contains recipes of simple dishes, and if one follows the instructions and methods properly, they should be able to learn cooking easily. It is meant for those who may not be skilled but want to learn to cook, as well as those who want to expand their knowledge of preparing various foods. It is also for those who, while not very experienced, are willing to try their hand at cooking and learn.

From this book, one can learn about different types of food and recipes. Therefore, I have made efforts to explain each method and recipe in simple terms, to help people understand and learn more easily. This way, people can learn new ways of preparing food and create more delicious and varied dishes.
